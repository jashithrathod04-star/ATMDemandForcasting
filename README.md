| **Relationship Analysis** | Correlation heatmaps and scatter plots with trend lines |

### 📈 ATM Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups ATMs into meaningful segments based on demand behavior
- **Optimal Cluster Selection**: Elbow method and silhouette score analysis for k selection
- **PCA Visualization**: 2D projection of ATM clusters for intuitive understanding
- **Cluster Profiles**: Interpretable summaries with key characteristics:
  - 🏙️ **High-demand**: Urban locations, high traffic, fewer competitors
  - 🏢 **Steady-demand**: Business hubs, consistent patterns
  - 🏡 **Low-demand**: Rural areas, seasonal usage

### 🚨 Anomaly Detection
- **Statistical Methods**: IQR-based outlier detection with dynamic thresholds
- **Machine Learning**: Isolation Forest for contextual anomaly detection
- **Holiday/Event Analysis**: Compares anomaly rates during special days
- **Visual Highlighting**: Time series with anomalies marked in red
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies unusual spikes that may indicate fraud or system issues

### ⚙️ Interactive Planner
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter by day, time, location, holidays, and events
- **Real-time Updates**: All visualizations and metrics update instantly
- **Cluster Assignment**: View ATM classifications with each transaction
- **Anomaly Flags**: Identify unusual transactions at a glance
- **Actionable Insights**: Data-driven recommendations for:
  - Cash loading schedules
  - Refill frequency optimization
  - Inventory management
  - Risk assessment

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide
### Common Issues and Solutions
#### 1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'statsmodels'
bash
`pip install statsmodels`
#### 2. FileNotFoundError: Dataset not found
```bash
# Check current directory
ls -la  # Linux/Mac
dir     # Windows

# Ensure file is in correct location
mv your_dataset.csv atm_cash_management_dataset.csv
```
#### 3. Memory Issues with Large Datasets
```python
# Add to app.py for data sampling
if len(df) > 100000:
    df = df.sample(n=100000, random_state=42)
    st.warning("⚠️ Dataset sampled to 100,000 rows for performance")
```
#### 4. Streamlit Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process using port 8501
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8501
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Linux/Mac
lsof -i :8501
kill -9 <PID>
```
#### 5. Plotly Rendering Issues
```bash
# Update plotly
pip install --upgrade plotly
```
## 🚀 Performance Optimization
Caching: @st.cache_data decorators for data loading and expensive computations

Lazy Loading: Visualizations render only when tabs are selected

Data Sampling: Optional sampling for large datasets

Efficient Filtering: Pandas boolean indexing for real-time updates
